            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
                I have designed a comprehensive V12 engine model on SOLIDWORKS certified by the Lebanese American University.
                In addition, I have conducted detailed stress analysis, motion studies, and flow simulations
                to validate performance and functionality. I developed a high-quality animation to demonstrate mechanical
                motion and compiled a professional engineering report to document the process and findings.
                <h4>Technical Overview</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Frontend:</b> The user interface is developed using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a smooth, responsive, and user-friendly experience. 
                        React components allow for interactive quiz creation and real-time updates. 
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Backend: </b> PHP handles user authentication, quiz data processing, and interaction with the MySQL database. The backend efficiently manages requests 
                        such as saving quiz results and retrieving quiz questions.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Database: </b>MySQL stores user data, quiz details, and quiz results. The database structure supports easy retrieval of quiz information and scalability 
                        as more users create or attempt quizzes.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Version Control: </b>the project is managed with Git, ensuring code versioning and collaboration potential.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>This project highlights full-stack development skills, covering both frontend and backend implementation. 
                It demonstrates proficiency in creating dynamic, interactive user interfaces with React and handling server-side logic using PHP. 
                The integration of MySQL showcases expertise in database management. Additionally, this project emphasizes problem-solving, 
                user experience design and scalability. Including this project in the portfolio demonstrates a well-rounded skill set in web 
                development, making it a strong asset for showcasing technical competency.
