            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
               As part of a group project, we conducted an in-depth investigation into vibration-assisted micro-texturing as a method to enhance the tribological
                performance of engineering surfaces. Our work combined extensive literature research, experimental analysis, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
                simulations to assess how key process parameters—such as spindle speed, feed rate, vibration frequency, tool geometry, workpiece hardness, and dimple
                density—affect the formation and characteristics of micro-dimples. The study examined their impact on friction reduction, surface roughness control,
                lubricant retention, and wear resistance, with findings validated through analytical modeling and simulation. Using MATLAB, SolidWorks, and ANSYS Fluent,
                we compared micro-texture geometries generated under different machining conditions, revealing that circular dimples produced at higher spindle speeds
                increased hydrodynamic pressure and improved friction performance. This comprehensive approach provided a deep understanding of the interplay between
                micro-texture geometry and surface functionality.
