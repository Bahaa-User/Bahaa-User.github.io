            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
               As part of the Mechanical Engineering Design course at the Lebanese American University, I co-designed and built a fully mechanical
            sorting machine to classify 69 steel disks (60 mm, 100 mm, 150 mm in diameter) based purely on size, without using any sensors or electronics. 
            The design leverages gravity, a sloped feeding chute, a thickness gate, and a motor-driven rotating shaft system with progressively increasing 
            shaft gaps to direct each disk into the correct collection box. All mechanical calculations—bearing loads, shaft stresses, fatigue life, buckling, 
            and torque requirements—were performed by hand and thoroughly verified using SolidWorks simulations and stress analysis. The final design ensures 
            structural integrity, high safety margins, and long-term durability, making it a robust, low-cost solution for industrial sorting applications.
