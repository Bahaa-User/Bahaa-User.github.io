            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
              I completed a project focused on the full HVAC design of the 4th floor of the Engineering Laboratory and Research Center (ELRC) at the Lebanese American 
              University. A comprehensive space-by-space analysis was conducted for laboratories, computer rooms, maker spaces, offices, and circulation areas. 
              The work included detailed cooling and heating load calculations based on ASHRAE Fundamentals, accounting for building orientation, envelope
              construction, internal equipment loads, lighting power density, infiltration, and ventilation requirements. System components were selected and
              sized accordingly, including air-handling units, airflow rates, and ductwork. The project emphasized engineering accuracy, energy efficiency, and 
              realistic operation in an educational and research environment.
