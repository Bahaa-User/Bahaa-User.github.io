            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
               As part of a collaborative effort with my talented team, we developed a prototype for a water
                level control system aimed at optimizing dam operations. Its operations focused on maintaining a 
                specific level of water by dispensing the specific amount of water required using a pump to achieve our desired goal.
                
                <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Closed-Loop Feedback System:</b> Integrated a PID controller to ensure precise regulation of water levels.</li>
                    <li><b>Sensor Integration:</b> Deployed ultrasonic sensors for accurate water level measurement.</li>
                    <li><b>Electronics and Automation:</b> Incorporated essential electronic components for seamless system operation.</li>

                </ul>
                This project demonstrates the power of control engineering in addressing real-world challenges such as water resource management, and it provided me with invaluable hands-on experience in systems design and implementation.
