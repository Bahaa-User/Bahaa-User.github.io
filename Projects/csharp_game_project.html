            <h2>Projects Description</h2>
            <p>Funded by the USAID Higher Education Scholarship (HES) program, our project aimed to promote 
                afforestation awareness and encourage sustainable agricultural practices among local farmers.
                As a team of six HES scholars, we were entrusted with a budget of $1,000 per member, which we strategically utilized to maximize impact.
                Our initiative included hosting a conference and awareness campaign in Chouf and Akkar, engaging 50 farmers from each region. These events
                featured expert-led discussions, practical demonstrations on sustainable farming techniques, and afforestation strategies, facilitated by
                a professional agricultural engineer.
                To support the farmers in implementing these practices, we distributed essential agricultural hand tools and provided hands-on training
                on their effective use.
               It is important to note that the HES management imposed specific restrictions on the types of projects we could conduct and the equipment we 
                were allowed to purchase. We carefully adhered to these guidelines throughout the project, ensuring full compliance while achieving our 
                objectives effectively.
