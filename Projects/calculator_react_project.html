            <p>
                The "Blinker" robot leverages advanced sensing technologies to assist visually impaired users in navigating the 
                university campus. It effectively detects and avoids obstacles such as stairs, walls, and other potential hazards,
                ensuring a safer and more accessible environment.
                <h4>As a team, we:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <lil>Created the complete robot design from scratch using SolidWorks, focusing on functionality and user-centric
                         design principles. </lil> 
                    <lil>Developed the kinematic model to ensure optimized and smooth movement for efficient navigation. </lil>
                    <lil>Fabricated the robot's components using cutting-edge techniques such as laser cutting and 3D printing to achieve
                        precision and durability. </lil>
                    <lil>Designed and built the driving circuit to power and control the robot's movements. </lil>
                    <lil>Programmed the robot using LabVIEW to enable seamless integration between hardware and software, ensuring accurate 
                        obstacle detection and path planning. </lil>
                    <lil>Worked closely with a multidisciplinary team of students, demonstrating strong teamwork and effective communication to
                         bring the project from concept to completion. </lil>
                </ul>
                
                This hands-on project enhanced our ability to apply engineering principles to solve real-world challenges and boosted our commitment to leveraging 
                technology for social good.
