            <h2>Internship Description</h2>
            <p>
              Completed a mechanical engineering internship at Middle East Airlines (MEA) – MEAG GSEM Department in Beirut, where I assisted in preventive
              and corrective maintenance of airport ground support equipment. Responsibilities included inspections, troubleshooting, and repair documentation
              of critical mechanical systems. I gained practical exposure to a wide range of automotive subsystems—including hydraulic, braking, lubrication,
              pumping, and turbocharging systems—along with hands-on work in engine disassembly and reassembly for both diesel and gasoline engines. The
              experience strengthened my skills in automotive diagnostics, component servicing, and compliance with aviation maintenance standards, while 
              enhancing my understanding of safety and operational procedures in an aviation environment.
