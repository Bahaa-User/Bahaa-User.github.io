            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>
               In this Augmented Reality project, I integrated my research on soft pneumatic sensing chambers with Arduino to create a real-time grip pressure
              visualization system. Designed for individuals with reduced tactile sensation due to injury or for users with prosthetic hands, the system uses a
              pressure sensor embedded in a wearable pneumatic chamber to detect the force applied by the user’s hand. Through an AR headset, the user sees a live
              bar-style indicator displaying the exact pressure value, along with a safe range based on the object’s fragility. This interactive feedback supports 
              rehabilitation training, assists in learning precise grip control, and helps prevent damage to delicate objects. The project combined hardware prototyping, 
              sensor calibration, and Unity-based AR interface development using C#, C++ and python to deliver an immersive and functional assistive technology solution.
