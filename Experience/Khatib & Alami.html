            <h2>Internship Description</h2>
            <p>
               Completed a two-month internship specializing in HVAC and piping design for large-scale projects, gaining hands-on experience in cooling
                and heating load calculations, ventilation sizing, and water/drainage pipe sizing. Worked extensively with HAP, Elite, Revit, AutoCAD, 
                and Excel to perform precise engineering analyses and produce technical drawings. Contributed to major projects including the IMC Medical 
                School in Jeddah and Middle East Airlines (MEA) facilities, developing skills in system design, project coordination, and application of
                international mechanical standards.
